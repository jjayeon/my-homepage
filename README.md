This is the Github repository for the website autumnchiu.com, where I (Autumn Chiu, famous programmer) store my various projects, ideas, and code.

## projects:

Bullet Hell JS: a bullet hell shooter written in pure Javascript.

Uncross the Lines: a unique implementation of the "uncross the lines" puzzle game, where you can group and move around multiple dots at once.

Input.js: a simple Javascript library for handling mouse and keyboard input in a granular, user-agnostic way.

SSG: a simple static site generator, good for rendering plain text with simple CSS backgrounds.

## packages:

npm and Yarn for package management, of course.

Webpack as our build system.

Babel for Javascript wrangling.

ESLint and Prettier for code formatting.

React.
